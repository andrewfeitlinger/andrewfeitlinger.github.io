# Preface
{: .no_toc}

This article is mostly functioning as a placeholder for right now so that the `Blog Posts` list has an entry in it.

I also wanted to do a little bit of research on how Jekyll (and Ruby) operate behind the scenes and understand what data the `site` global variable contains. Of course, the settings will vary slightly depending on whether the site is built locally on my computer or remotely from my GitHub repository.

The `site` global variable is a Ruby Hash (Associative Array) data structure. It is automatically generated by Jekyll when the site is built using the `jekyll build` command from a terminal session.

The raw output is just a data dump of the entire variable. The formatted output is the same key and value pairs separated into individual tables which were generated using Kramdown, Liquid, and CSS.
